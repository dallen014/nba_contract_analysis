    "The contract value for active players has already been extracted from the NBA API and merged with aggregated NBA stats. For players who were drafted from a college/university, we will get their college statistics and draft information for use in a regression analysis using contract value as the target variable. Unfortuantely, the NBA API that is publically available for free and without subscription does not include college stats. It does however, include draft histroy (player name, season, round number and pick, team and organization drafted from) for all NBA teams. This will be merged with the previously aggregated contract value dataset. From that, we'll create a list of players of whom we will scrape their college basketball stats from https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/. "
